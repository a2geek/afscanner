# Apple Disk II address field scanner

This application is my lame attempt to understand the old Apple Disk II interface.  This included writing the read, decode, and physical routines to move the disk arm.

## Software required to build:
* [Merlin32](http://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/merlin/index.html) by Brutal Deluxe
* The command-line variant of [AppleCommander](https://sites.google.com/site/drjohnbmatthews/applecommander)
* Either a real Apple II or an emulator
